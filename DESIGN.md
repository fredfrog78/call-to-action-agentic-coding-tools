# Agentic Coding Tools — Website Design Notes

## Goal
Convince **software engineers and researchers** to try *agentic coding tools* (Codex, Claude, Gemini, etc.) by:
- Making the value proposition concrete for **brownfield** work.
- Reducing adoption friction with a **30‑minute pilot** and a worked example.
- Addressing accuracy/security/maintainability concerns with **credible, non-hand-wavy guardrails**.

## Persuasion & UX patterns used
This site follows common high-conversion landing page patterns, adapted for a skeptical, technical audience:

1. **Clear value proposition above the fold**
   - One-sentence headline + subhead (benefit + how).
   - Primary CTA (“Start a 30‑minute pilot”) + secondary CTA (“See the worked example”).

2. **Visual hierarchy that matches user questions**
   - What is this? → Why should I care? → How does it work? → Can I trust it? → What do I do next?

3. **Minimize distractions**
   - Simple nav, no popups, no autoplay, no carousels.

4. **Social proof + evidence**
   - Use real survey/research stats.
   - Show caveats (trust gap, “almost right” frustration) to build credibility.

5. **Objection handling (concerns)**
   - FAQ that treats concerns as valid and answers with concrete mitigation steps.

6. **Progressive disclosure**
   - Fast skim path (cards, bullets, diagram) plus deeper details (tabs, accordions, references).

## Information architecture (single-page)
1. Hero: value prop + CTA
2. “Phase change” explanation: autocomplete → chat → agentic loop
3. “What they can do in brownfield code” use cases
4. Evidence section (balanced)
5. Worked example with prompts + screenshots (illustrative)
6. Quickstart: 30‑minute pilot checklist
7. FAQ: accuracy, security/privacy, licensing, workflow integration
8. References + footer
